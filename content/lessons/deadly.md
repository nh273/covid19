IFR, CFR, etc.
It affects certain age groups more than others.
It affects certain underlying conditions.

## But if it kills so few people why are we reacting to it like this?

It's very infectious. R_o suspected to be >3, maybe even 6.
Exponential growth: give example of how many people will be infected in a week without social distancing. => overwhelms hospital.

## How widespread?

WE DON'T REALLY KNOWN HOW WIDESPREAD IT IS.
Most countries don't test enough people.
People suspect that x5 - x10 the reported number are infected.
Good news = the mortality is a lot lower than we thought
Bad news = the number of people killed are already a lot higher than we thought

## Why test?

There are 2 tests:
PCR (what people have been doing) to find currently infected people.
Need more of that if we want to lift lockdown.
Antibody test to find people who have been infected & recovered -> develop resistance to the virus.
We need antibody testing to find out how many people have already gotten it without knowing. These people likely have immunity -> they don't have to be locked down, they can donate plasma to help the severly infected.

## Can we trust the reported data?

No.
Countries record deaths differently.
