Why does it take so long to find a cure/vaccine?

## Cure

Clinical trial:
Phase 1 is mainly for safety
Phase 2 is to find dosage range in human
Phase 3 is double blind randomized control to determine effectiveness

Kinda explain why Phase 3 is necessary:
Most people with COVID-19 will get better on their own anyway.
So if you give everyone the drug, you don't know if they are getting better from the drug or just on their own.
So you randomly give half of patients sugar pills (placebo), half the real drug to see if the real drug actually works better than sugar pills.
The patients and the doctors directly giving the drugs to the patients cannot know who get the placebo and who get the real drug, because there is proof that that can influence the outcome.

Normally it takes years but right now it's already been rushed to take months.
There are drugs already on the market to treat other diseases being repurposed -> passed Phase 1 & 2 already, now only need to see if it can really treat COVID-19.

Drugs have side effects, and also we need to make sure we are not wasting resource on a cure that doesn't work.

"Compassionate use" -> you can already use pre-Phase 3 drugs on people in critical conditions.

## Vaccine

Also has to go through clinical trial.
Vaccine is trickier because you are injecting billions of healthy people with it.
So need to really make sure there are no short & long term side effects, and that immunity is long-lasting.
